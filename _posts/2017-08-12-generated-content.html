title: Generate content with :before and :after
---

<h2>CSS Triangle</h2>

<div class="box">This is a comment</div>

<p>The trick here is to add content with :before or :after that has height and width of 0, solid transparent border of some width and border-top-color with the same color as the box.
  In addition this generated content is positioned absolutely. Here is the code:</p>

{% highlight sass %}
.box
background-color: #40a728
color: white
font-weight: bold
margin: 2em
padding: 1em
border-radius: 5px
position: relative

&:after
content: ""
position: absolute
bottom: -19px
left: 20px
width: 0
height: 0
border: 10px solid transparent
border-top-color: #40a728
{% endhighlight %}
